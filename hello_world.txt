[13] The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.

[17] On 16 June Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.
[18] Torvalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project.
[19] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer.[20]
